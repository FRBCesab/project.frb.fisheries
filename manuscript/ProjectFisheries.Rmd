The project is available on _[github](https://github.com/samuelcharberet/project.frb.fisheries)_

## 1. R work environment

For this project we used:  
* renv  
* Rmarkdown  
* ggplot2  
* Targets  

## 2. Data
### 2.1. Data extracted  
---
* __Carbone (C), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P)__ content (% of dry mass) from Jabot, F. et al., (2020): Dataset for the article "Body stoichiometry of heterotrophs: assessing drivers of interspecific variations in elemental composition". figshare. Dataset. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13366310.v1  
---
* __Tonnage__ from _Sea Around Us_ We downloaded data for the Barents Sea area on the Website:  https://www.seaaroundus.org/

### 2.2. Data manipulation  

Having two different dataset has required to join them. However, the species name were not exactly noted the same way on the two documents. Therefore we had to do some cleaning/filetering on both datasets. 


### 2.3. Final dataset  

Our final dataset contains:  
* Carbone (C)  
* Nitrogen (N)  
* Phosphorus (P)  
* Species (n species of fishes)  
* Tonnage  
* Countries  
* Type of gear
