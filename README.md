# projet_frb

We extract catch data from SeaAroundUs and transform it to obtain carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus excracted, first from the Barents Sea.
We use a research compendium, Git, GitHub, as well as the target package to manage data wrangling steps, and renv packages to make our analysis reproducible.
